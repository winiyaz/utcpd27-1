# Modern Cross Platform GUI 

### Tkinter 

1. This is from python standard lib note additional installs might not be required
2. Consider what is the use case for this 
3. [`ttkbootstrap``](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Bootstrap themes for tkinter. Easiest fo building pretty GUI apps

## PuQt - Cross Platform GUI

[PyQt](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/)
- After doing some smellpanty reserach this is the very common cross platform framework
- Different from tkinter ( which is part of python standard lib , and still useful for simple applications )
- Note requires additional installation of pkgs in windows, maybe thats why you havent come across mention of this. 

## [`Textualize`](https://www.textualize.io/)

1. This is referring to a CLI framework for the application not GUI
2. [`Textualize``](https://www.textualize.io/) is the most used TUI generator. Note the RICH pythion package is also made by these guys 

## [`StreamLIT`](https://streamlit.io/) 

1. For building data apps 
2. You can also host it on steamlit cloud which is linked to this
3. Note need to find out how to make that run in pycharm
